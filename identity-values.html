        <p class="blogCopy"> <span class="dropCap">E</span>thics is a rather large topic that I tend to avoid for the reason that I am quite vanilla across the board. I recognise that people both make mistakes, and they may redeem themselves at a future state of events, but I also recognise at the same time that mistakes may have consequences for others and cause harm in the process. </p>
        <img class="blogBanner" src="images/blogs/blog-3/banner.png" alt="#">
        <p>It is probably a good idea to have a set of principles that we can agree to live by. I personally do not find myself in situations where I need to lie, cheat and steal. Ethically however I don’t have any experiences that I can draw form where I’ve had to make any tough choices. I am the type of person to return wallets full of cash to the police station and to teach people rather than hurt them. In most situations, I am slow to judge. Where ethics falls into this, I am uncertain, but as an undergraduate in philosophy I learned of the idea of being a “contentious moral agent” and I suppose that has stuck with me all these years.  </p>
        <p>My strengths may come from an ability to find the passion in what I am doing and let that drive the majority of the learning process. In a career setting however dream jobs are rare and hard to come by. By taking small steps toward becoming a junior javascript developer I think that passion could come through and if I am able to finish my work, the culture that surrounds that workplace may benefit form a little positivity. </p>
        <p>My ability to focus is unusual but it can go both ways: I can focus on things for a long time, but if I go down a rabbit role then I focus too much attention on tasks lower down on the priority list. Learning how to recognise these episodes may be beneficial and avoided by time management tools and clear goals that is chunked into achievable timeframes. </p>
        <p>Learning with others can be a challenge if the personality types do not gel. I have personally worked with what I would call quite obnoxious person but that was perhaps too judgemental. Often it is just the sense of constantly listening to a talkative person when you realise at the point of somebody repeating what they have said, that what they are saying may be not that efficient and they are doing it to feel heard. This culture may work for some but it does not work that well for me. What I did to work with this person was to reinforce positive aspects to what they were saying, making sure they understood they knew I had listened and understood myself, and then when things were getting repeated I would kindly remind that person that I had heard them the first time and we ought to move on to other things. It worked in the end and we managed to remain friendly toward one another, whereas there was certainly a capability for me to find disinterest in said person. I think being a good team member is learning the nuances of other personality types and recognising that it may not be them that is the issue rather the clash of decision making involved. Remaining objective is key for team work, I had learned.</p>
        <p>Thank you for reading &hearts; It is always awkward writing these sorts of things.</p>
