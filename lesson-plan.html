                <p class="blogCopy"> <span class="dropCap">T</span>hanks to EDA, my long term goal for this year is to become a Junior JavaScript developer and work my way up the industry hierarchy over the course of next year. I can foresee myself doing web development work for the next three years, building up a body of knowledge capable of building modern digital products. I am specifically interested in learning react and node.</p>
                <img class="blogBanner" src="images/blogs/blog-4/banner.png" alt="#">
                <p>My strength in learning comes from my disciplined ability to stay focused and work on a problem until a solution is found. Sometimes that solution may be to abandon the issue and take a step back to then return with another approach. The limitations of my learning are absolutely to do with interest. I always aim to achieve a sense of flow in my learning, and when confronted with less than ideal (read: dry) tasks, I can lose interest quite rapidly and become demotivated. Awareness of these aspects to my learning is also a strength as it can allow me to recognise problem areas early and deal to them appropriately.  </p>
                <p>I would really like to connect with like-minded individuals and improve my listening abilities even further. I can also have a tendency from my own teaching background to find myself in advice giving situations. I would like to learn how to avoid these sorts of approaches and become more of an effective leader through other means.</p>
                <p>I have a fairly strict schedule and do quite well sticking to it. My workload management is well under control as I have allowed myself these three months to focus exclusively on this learning journey. I will manage myself and work productively by being polite, respectful, eager to both listen and help where and when I can, and bringing a sense of all-round positivity and enjoyment to the learning environment.</p>
                <p>Sometimes I may need to just take a weekend to myself away from people so I can recharge. Things can become overwhelming so two main strategies I have used in the past is to finish work in a timely manner, this means to stay on track. The second is to learn how to reduce workload and do not let my ambitions direct me toward taking on more work that needed. As a result, doing the required tasks first and then elaborating on them (such as stretch goals) is a sound strategy to avoid the common pitfalls of workload stress that comes with taking on too much all at once.</p>
                <p>The community and staff at EDA are open and easily approachable, I would get in contact with my student facilitator, Rose, and discuss how EDA could help support me in times of need. </p>
                <p>I am in a committed relationship and I block in time with my partner that fits outside of work hours. We are both well versed in this lifestyle and have discussed the increase of my workload as a result of taking this course of education. I need not to neglect my family and friends if I can manage to work in my own timely fashion. Fortunately, I do have a fairly structured balance in my life at the moment that surrounds and supports my educational goals. Growing does not happen in isolation nor without helping hands.</p>
