    within css grid, the content of each item is located in a box which is referred to as a cell. You can align the content's position within its cell horizontally using the justify-self property on a grid item. By default, this property has a value of stretch, which will make the content fill the whole width of the cell. This CSS Grid Property acepts other values as well:
        start: aligns the content at the left of the cell,
        center: aligns the content in the center of the cell,
        end: aligns the content at the right of the cell.
        justify-self: start, center, end; 
        
        ---align-self--- this works for vertical instructions.
        ---justify-items--- this works for ALL items within the grid (horizontal)
        ---align-items--- this works for ALL items within th grid (vertical)

  /* 
  
    You can group cells of your grid together into an area and give the area a custom name. Do this by uding grid-template-areas on the container: .;
    i.e, 
        grid-template-areas:
            "header header header"
            "advert content content"
            "footer footer footer"

    The code above merges the top three cells together into an area named header, the bottom three cells into a footer area, and it makes two areas in the middle row; advert and content. Every word in the 'grid matrix' represents the grid system in question. 

    once this has been completed, (the grid set up) you are welcome to now add 
        
        .element {
            grid-area: header;
        }

    This lets the grid know that you would like the targeted element to go into the grid area that you have predefined as 'header'.


    The grid area can also be used without grid-template-areas. For example:

        Grid-area: horizontal line to start at / vertical line to start at / horizontal line to end at / vertical line to end at;

        e.g: 
            grid-area: 1/1/4/4; (starts at far left for both x,y) (ends at 4,4 for both x,y)

        
        Grid template rows allow you to refactor your code to minimize repetition.

            e.g:

        grid-template-rows: repeat(100, 50px);
        
        You can also repeat multiple values with the repeat function and insert the function amongst other values when defining a grid structure. Here's what that looks like:

        grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr 50px) 20px;

        minmax

        grid-template-columns: 100px minmax(50px, 200px); 

        You can specify with the grid system a minmax value. This is helpful for when the user would like to resize their browser window.


        The repeat function comes with an option called auto-fill.

            repeat(auto-fill, minmax(60px, 1fr));

        (this will mathematically calculate how many rows or columns will fit)
