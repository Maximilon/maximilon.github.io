      <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>

      <p class="blogCopy"> <span class="dropCap">I</span>have learned that I can keep to a schedule if I remain focused and disciplined on the task at hand. However, I have also learned that if I want to do my best work I need to drive and push myself through apathetic moments and take control. I’m a little older than I once was and as a result my ego is rather in harmony these days. I celebrate the potential in others to grow. We all have our moments. </p>
  
      <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>

      <p>I’m not too sure how to answer this objectively. Learning to program is quite an individual experience. I first learned to program because I was fascinated with how code was written. I did not meet anybody who could code for a long time in my life, but I suspect that If I had I would of taken to it quite strongly growing up. When I first learned JavaScript I found it incredibly difficult. With time however, I learned that certain benchmarks such as logical operations and control flows, and so on, is more like philosophy than mathematics. Values are therefore subjective to the desire for code. I wanted to learn how to build things in modern ways. </p> 

      <p>Self-awareness in learning is absolutely more of a guide in how I learn. If I have a learning objective, then I will persist and explore that space until I am satisfied with the knowledge gained. If you are constantly focused on your own learning however than the learning of others may be neglected as a result. Empathy may therefore contribute to celebrating the learning journey of others and provide a way to relate to the network of likeminded individuals as a whole. I’ve absolutely met passionate programmers before and if people tend to take more positive outlooks toward building things than turning quick profits, then perhaps more things could get made. </p> 
    
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>

      <p>The lack of ES6. I was expecting more modern updates on older ways of doing things I am being completely honest. </p>


      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>

      <p>I found the algorithm challenges the hardest. There are so many ways to solve problems in JavaScript. I really needed to hit the books to remember a lot of key terminology and techniques to accomplish the tasks successfully.</p>


      <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>

      <p>There are simply fundamental skills required for any programming task. Without the code knowledge, the bootcamp may run at a pace unforgiving to students who lack the fundamentals.</p>

      <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>

      <p>I felt that half of the core was good whilst half was a bit of a time sink. I actually used that time to practice programming before looking at the challenges. I will spend the next week continuing to explore and study JavaScript. Again this has to do with the lack of ES6 content. I understand how an absolute beginner may struggle with this however.</p>

This is all too often a reoccurring cycle: read and interpret a problem, attempt to solve it, fail to remember the right techniques, write some code that you feel is bad, and then fail the challenge. </p>
  
      <p>Encountering these moments, and other moments like them, will always be part of what it takes to be a successful programmer. Fortunately, there are common problem-solving techniques that can help before any code is typed.</p> 

      <p>Pseudocode is one of the main ways to think through an unfamiliar programming problem. Pseudocode is verbal, loosely described instructions. For example, “loop through an array”. Although this is a surface level goal, to instruct the machine to perform this activity requires a little knowledge of that language’s syntax. Before writing any code, and by having a list of pseudo-instructions, we can start to have more of a general plan on how to approach the syntax that is yet to come. This technique of thinking through the issue and providing yourself with a loose plan on how to approach a problem may, by the very process of writing pseudo code, solve the problem you seek to answer.</p> 
      
      <p>Once a detailed plan has been thought about, the next part is remembering how to translate that pseudo code into workable instructions. Googling, reviewing old notes or codebases, trial and error, these movements are part of what it takes to be a successful problem solver. Yet often we forget these steps and could neglect in our moments of being clever that the best solution is often the simplest. I therefore solve the issue in the simplest way I know how and then attempt to refactor the code in more clever ways. This is what it means for me to be an effective learner and problem solver whilst practicing javascript.</p>

      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>

      <p class="blogCopy"> <span class="dropCap">T</span>he principles of neuroplasticity may benefit people by providing a model for understanding the how the brain adapts to learning. A common, perhaps outdated view of learning may be to presume that, for example, people are born with certain natural abilities towards some things in life whilst having reduced capabilities in others. Take the typical ideas of learning math, art, music, sport and so on. Often, we can recognise talent in people’s ability to pick certain subjects up faster than others. Neuroplasticity, however, champions the idea that although natural talent is a part of life, the human brain is highly capable of learning, changing its physical pathways, and literally remoulding the wire that connect our thoughts together.</p>
  
      <p>Having access to a theory which upholds the notion of learning being an effort-based activity is rewarding. This may benefit learning attitudes: learning is possible for anybody across many difficulty levels.</p> 

      <p>Repetition is one of the primary ways to increase neuroplasticity, considering many alternative approaches and frameworks to help understand one subject or topic of discussion, is another. </p> 
      
      <h3>Research growth mindset</h3>
      <p>The research growth mindset relates to some of the ways to increase neuroplasticity such that intelligence can be developed. Often contrasted with a fixed mindset, the growth mindset may liberate students who experience self-doubt. I have always had a natural link to a research growth mindset due to a series of random events in my life which have led me to learn things that I would never imagine I would be able to learn. I know from first-hand experience that this mindset can help if the student is dedicated to learning.  It placed me in a position of positive learning relationship, a dedication to hard work, and a way to cope when things got tough. </p>

      <p>Considering the theory of neuroplasticity in combination of having a research growth mindset may influence my learning strategy. I have always valued the role of revision in my learning. Building practical examples through my own approaches and providing myself little daily tests and challenges may reinforce the idea that I can continue to grow my knowledge rather than expect to grasp things as a natural.</p>

      <h3 class="subHead">What's the difference between HTML & CSS?</h3>
    
      <p class="blogCopy"> <span class="dropCap">H</span>ypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are two technologies used to organise and describe content on websites. To understand the differences between the two languages we first need to understand how each are involved in the process of building websites.</p>
  
      <p>If we take a generic magazine for example, we can see its cover as typically consisting of a title, an image, an author name, and some paragraph text. These items according to html are pieces of content and can be categorised or described by using an html tag or element. For example, an title would be suited for a &lt;h1&gt; element, an image would suit a &lt;img&gt; element, an author name or paragraph text may be represented with a &lt;p&gt; tag. These HTML elements (h1, img, p) are ‘marking up’ the magazine content into categories. These labels only have one purpose: To describe the content they keep. Web browsers use these descriptions to provide semantic meaning to them with code. In short, breaking down content into categories, little descriptive elements, help ‘wrap’ that content and ‘mark it up’ so hypertexts (the underlying technology of the world wide web) become operational. </p> 

      <p>Once the content of a website has been described in HTML, a developer may wish to change the way this content looks. Realising this aesthetic goal is achievable thanks to CSS. With this technology, we may select our earlier described pieces of content and apply instructions to them directly. A simple example may be to change the font style or colour of a title. To do this, we would first ask the browser to find our previously described &lt;h1&gt; and then ask it to add a style to this element (font-family: Helvetica;) as an example. Consequently, if HTML is used to structure and organise content, CSS is used to instruct the way it looks using a large number of built-in properties taken from the design world.</p> 
      
      <p>In sum, a useful analogy to help understand these differences between the languages (the structural and the aesthetic) may be to think of HTML as the work of collecting, organising, labelling, and then transporting building supplies to a customer in the form of a kit-set, like an Ikea Wooden Desk. Once this kit-set has arrived to the customer safely, these materials are unpacked and ready to be assembled. With each item in hand, it is now time to pick up the instructions and follow them, assembling each component piece-by-piece. For example, “select the screw b1 and then add it to the left leg” is not distant from a common CSS instruction. In this way, the difference between HTML and CSS wrests in the way the materials are organised and assembled and then require further instruction for an assembly to take place. Both HTML and CSS work together to make a website.</p>

      <h3>if(Control Flow)</h3>
      <p>Control flow is a programmer’s term to describe a logical operation. But prior to understanding this it may be beneficial to understand that machines execute instructions one at a time. This sequentiality is definite. That is, one instruction, always follows another next. Electronic computers are capable of following these instructions, fast (think millions may happen per second!). Given this backdrop to the technology we are working with, we may ask: what happens when we want to return to instructions that we have already given? Control flow helps with this. </p>

      <p>One evening this week we may decide to follow a newly found risotto recipe and cook a meal from scratch. To do this we (1) purchase the ingredients from the list; (2) prepare them. We are now ready to cook. Step one is to add oil to a pan and heat it up. Step two is to then add onions to soften. While these onions are softening we are to cut the mushrooms. So far, these instructions are sequential: one follows another next. We could potentially cook an entire meal in this way without running into any major issues. But say, during this process, we hear the doorbell ring and go to answer it, during which, our onions start to burn. Upon returning to the kitchen we are greeted with our onions engulfed in flames. Panic mode, we ought to swiftly react and douse the flames, yet the beginnings of our meal may be ruined in the aftermath and we will have to start over again. Rather, we continue on with the instructions. Next we add the risotto rice to brown alongside the flaming, burning onion. Eventually we finish following the recipe and end up with a less than desirable meal.</p>

      <p>In this case, we ought to have stopped cooking much earlier but we have not accounted for contingencies in our instructions. In a way, they were instructions that took for granted that other contextual factors such as people ringing our doorbells would be dealt to. Alongside it being impossible to write every contingency possible, computers, unfortunately, do not have this luxury to understand context like humans do. As the saying goes, machines are dumb but very very fast. </p>

      <p>Control statements allow us to ask certain conditions to our set of instructions which in turn adapt the flow of events. For example, we could have expressed a condition for our cooking: If (and only if) our onions are soft, then remove them from the heat, otherwise keep cooking. In terms of programming we now have two options: If the first condition (onions are soft) is true, then take them off the heat. Else (the onions are not soft) which is false, then continue to cook them. This binary representation (true or false) is a Boolean condition. It is also fundamental to machines (1 or 0). This is to do with the physical circuit boards themselves. Electricity, as far as we know as a human species only has two states: it is either positive or negative. Given this, we can build machines that represent these two states and control the flow of electricity of the circuity. There is a reason that machines are plugged into walls and draw their power from the public generation of energy stored on the power grid. This is very abstract and low-level however. For our purposes here, we can understand control flow as ‘conditional’. That is, if one condition is true, do that, otherwise, do something else. </p>

      <p>Loops are similar in the sense that they ask if a condition is true. For example, if our onions are cooked. If this condition is true, then we ask that condition again. How this is different is the second testing. This principal is called recursion. Recursion allows us to create ‘loops’ where we keep returning to the condition asking whether it is true or not. As already mentioned, because computers are very fast, recursion happens really fast. In fact the fact we can read anything on a machine in the first place is because of a loop asking if the power is turned on. In more practical terms, loops typically are used to count things until a condition is false. Or, iterate though a list of things and find occurrences of matches.</p>

      <h3>What's the deal with DOM?</h3>
      <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a native browser based Application Programming Interface (API). What this means is that the people who create web browsers have built into that software a way for other programmers to talk to web browsers through code at a higher level. When a web page is loaded for example, the browser automatically creates a representation of that web page using the DOM. It is important to recognise that the DOM is separate from the HTML document. When we manipulate the DOM we are not manipulating the HTML document. Typically, JavaScript is the language which interacts with the DOM. We may for example have designed a website that we want to change the appearance into ‘dark mode or light mode’. To organise this code we build a button that when pushes changes the styles to match the associated theme. A user story or sequence may be as follows: the user pushes the button; the browser registers that click and then adds a class to the DOM called ‘theme’. This class toggles between two states. If the user presses the button again, the theme is thus toggled. In this way the DOM sits between the browser and the programmer’s code. It is an intermediary between both code bases and it facilitates communication between them.</p>
<h3>Common data structures</h3>
      <p>Accessing data from arrays and objects differ in one main way: keys. Arrays have key-value pairs whereas objects have properties. Fruit[0] for example is the index of the first item of a list of fruits. Whereas a fruit object would contain more associative key’s that describe properties, such as sugar content, price, weight, colour, and so on. In sum, both arrays and objects are data structures but they are used to organise data in very specific and distinct ways. Arrays are variables that have multiple data values whereas objects are containers that store properties of variables. </p>
      <h3>Functions()</h3>
      <p>Functions are useful for various reasons such as when we would like to repeat a set of previously issued instructions. This reusability of sections of code are what make functions powerful. A function is thus a block of code designed to perform a particular task. In our cooking example we had to cook onions. I am sure we have cooked onions many times before in our lives. This function of ‘cooking onions’ is thus repeated and reusable every time we would like to cook onions. Consequently, when we code a series of instructions, we may find ourselves in a situation that we would like to repeat earlier sections of code. Functions provide us with this functionality, no pun intended.</p>

      <p class="blogCopy"> <span class="dropCap">E</span>motional intelligence is often contrasted with intellectual intelligence. My understanding of intelligence is probably less binary of a definition and more of a holistic awareness that intelligence is a measurement rather than an entity. For example, being contextually aware is more of a sign of intelligence for me than any other metric. If I can see how people respond to the immediate context that they find themselves within I am able to make judgements on the intelligence of their actions. In this way, intelligence is a practical action.</p>
  
      <p>Empathy seems to be a keyword passed around these days. How empathic somebody is toward someone else could be a sign of emotional intelligence. Yet there may also be a consideration worthy for further discussion here. Boundaries, for instance, play a role in allowing empathy to not venture too far. Having strong boundaries also may require strong communication and relationship building skills. Emotional intelligence is also part of this side of the coin.</p> 

      <p>Ultimately, emotional intelligence could be valued when working with others. As we are increasingly finding flexible means to collaborate, having somebody who can recognise the opportunities to connect with others and build local cultures is a sure sign of intelligence, regardless of how you would like to define it.</p>

      <h2>Outdated layout techniques? Reflecting on the Float Method.</h2>

      </div>
      
      <p class="blogCopy"> <span class="dropCap">T</span>he surest way to think about the float property is to first consider the way browsers render elements through a typical default flow. Browsers render the majority of html elements by default as block-level elements. A block-level element, for example, spans the full width of its container and has its height either relative to the hight of its content (text, images, other child elements, et cetera) or has its height pre-set with code. As a result, we can use this behaviour to stack elements on top of one another, like the name implies – as blocks. To illustrate, take the following exercise of stacking three squares of equal width and height on top of one another: </p>
      <pre><xmp>
        /* css */
        div {
          width: 150px;
          height: 100px;
          background-color: red;
        }

        <!-- html-->
        <div class="box1">box1</div>
        <div class="box2">box2</div>
        <div class="box3">box3</div>
      </xmp></pre>
      <p>The above code will provide you with a pattern similar to Figure A below: </p>
      <img src="images/blogs/blog-1/blockA.png" alt="#" width="33%" height="">
      <p>All is natural in the world. But how, if we do not want vertical-stack arrangements, do we stack elements horizontially as shown in Figure B below?</p>
      <img src="images/blogs/blog-1/blockB.png" alt="#" width="100%">
      
      <p>One option we have available, is float:</p>
      <pre><xmp>
        div {
          width: 150px;
          height: 100px;
          background-color: red;
          float: left; /* you could float left, right, or center */
        }
      </xmp></pre>
        
       <p>If the browser often stacks elements into block-level vertical stacks such as Figure A above, how do we stack them horizontially? There is another CSS property available to choose from, the display property, however, if we would like to retain the block level property to our elements this is not a good option because one aspect of block level elements is that they contain most of their box-model properties, such as margin. An alternative is available for us when we would like to create horizontially aligned block level items: The float property.</p>
       
       <p>Now having available to us a technique to choose from which aligns elements from vertical to horizontal configurations, we can start to manipulate box model properties and specify the shapes and spaces required of our particular design. For example, for this website, the header was built by using the float method. I did this by first creating a Figure B configuration and then adapting the width of certain elements, namely the logo, nav bar, and button. The below code is only a brief example of what this may look like:</p>

       <pre><xmp>
         /* css */
         header {
           width: 100%
           height: 200px;
         }
         h1 {
           width: 25%;
           float: left;
         }
         nav {
           width: 50%;
           float: left;
         }
         button {
           width: 25%;
           float: left;
         }

        <!-- html-->
        <header>
            <h1>logo</h1>
            <nav>
              <ul>
                <li><a>item</a></li>
                <li><a>item</a></li>
                <li><a>item</a></li>
              </ul>
            </nav>
            <button>button</button>
        </header>
      </xmp></pre>

      <p>By isolating three boxes and playing around with their dimensions a developer may find ways to create arragnments that work for their particular design. In any case I am happy to have introduced the basic principles of using the float method, albeit just the tip of the iceburg.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, the float method is used for older-browser versions. New layout techniques are avaialble for more modern user environments. For example, both flexbox and grid are now considered the industry stantard approaches for laying out web pages. Because of this, my next task in my HTML/CSS learning is to recode this website using both flexbox and grid whilst leaving float in the dust! Thanks for reading.</p>

      <p class="blogCopy"> <span class="dropCap">T</span>hanks to EDA, my long term goal for this year is to become a Junior JavaScript developer and work my way up the industry hierarchy over the course of next year. I can foresee myself doing web development work for the next three years, building up a body of knowledge capable of building modern digital products. I am specifically interested in learning react and node.</p>
      <img class="blogBanner" src="images/blogs/blog-4/banner.png" alt="#">
      <p>My strength in learning comes from my disciplined ability to stay focused and work on a problem until a solution is found. Sometimes that solution may be to abandon the issue and take a step back to then return with another approach. The limitations of my learning are absolutely to do with interest. I always aim to achieve a sense of flow in my learning, and when confronted with less than ideal (read: dry) tasks, I can lose interest quite rapidly and become demotivated. Awareness of these aspects to my learning is also a strength as it can allow me to recognise problem areas early and deal to them appropriately.  </p>
      <p>I would really like to connect with like-minded individuals and improve my listening abilities even further. I can also have a tendency from my own teaching background to find myself in advice giving situations. I would like to learn how to avoid these sorts of approaches and become more of an effective leader through other means.</p>
      <p>I have a fairly strict schedule and do quite well sticking to it. My workload management is well under control as I have allowed myself these three months to focus exclusively on this learning journey. I will manage myself and work productively by being polite, respectful, eager to both listen and help where and when I can, and bringing a sense of all-round positivity and enjoyment to the learning environment.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I may need to just take a weekend to myself away from people so I can recharge. Things can become overwhelming so two main strategies I have used in the past is to finish work in a timely manner, this means to stay on track. The second is to learn how to reduce workload and do not let my ambitions direct me toward taking on more work that needed. As a result, doing the required tasks first and then elaborating on them (such as stretch goals) is a sound strategy to avoid the common pitfalls of workload stress that comes with taking on too much all at once.</p>
      <p>The community and staff at EDA are open and easily approachable, I would get in contact with my student facilitator, Rose, and discuss how EDA could help support me in times of need. </p>
      <p>I am in a committed relationship and I block in time with my partner that fits outside of work hours. We are both well versed in this lifestyle and have discussed the increase of my workload as a result of taking this course of education. I need not to neglect my family and friends if I can manage to work in my own timely fashion. Fortunately, I do have a fairly structured balance in my life at the moment that surrounds and supports my educational goals. Growing does not happen in isolation nor without helping hands.</p>

      <p class="blogCopy"> <span class="dropCap">E</span>thics is a rather large topic that I tend to avoid for the reason that I am quite vanilla across the board. I recognise that people both make mistakes, and they may redeem themselves at a future state of events, but I also recognise at the same time that mistakes may have consequences for others and cause harm in the process. </p>
      <img class="blogBanner" src="images/blogs/blog-3/banner.png" alt="#">
      <p>It is probably a good idea to have a set of principles that we can agree to live by. I personally do not find myself in situations where I need to lie, cheat and steal. Ethically however I don’t have any experiences that I can draw form where I’ve had to make any tough choices. I am the type of person to return wallets full of cash to the police station and to teach people rather than hurt them. In most situations, I am slow to judge. Where ethics falls into this, I am uncertain, but as an undergraduate in philosophy I learned of the idea of being a “contentious moral agent” and I suppose that has stuck with me all these years.  </p>
      <p>My strengths may come from an ability to find the passion in what I am doing and let that drive the majority of the learning process. In a career setting however dream jobs are rare and hard to come by. By taking small steps toward becoming a junior javascript developer I think that passion could come through and if I am able to finish my work, the culture that surrounds that workplace may benefit form a little positivity. </p>
      <p>My ability to focus is unusual but it can go both ways: I can focus on things for a long time, but if I go down a rabbit role then I focus too much attention on tasks lower down on the priority list. Learning how to recognise these episodes may be beneficial and avoided by time management tools and clear goals that is chunked into achievable timeframes. </p>
      <p>Learning with others can be a challenge if the personality types do not gel. I have personally worked with what I would call quite obnoxious person but that was perhaps too judgemental. Often it is just the sense of constantly listening to a talkative person when you realise at the point of somebody repeating what they have said, that what they are saying may be not that efficient and they are doing it to feel heard. This culture may work for some but it does not work that well for me. What I did to work with this person was to reinforce positive aspects to what they were saying, making sure they understood they knew I had listened and understood myself, and then when things were getting repeated I would kindly remind that person that I had heard them the first time and we ought to move on to other things. It worked in the end and we managed to remain friendly toward one another, whereas there was certainly a capability for me to find disinterest in said person. I think being a good team member is learning the nuances of other personality types and recognising that it may not be them that is the issue rather the clash of decision making involved. Remaining objective is key for team work, I had learned.</p>
