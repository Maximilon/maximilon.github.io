      <p class="blogCopy"> <span class="dropCap">E</span>motional intelligence is often contrasted with intellectual intelligence. My understanding of intelligence is probably less binary of a definition and more of a holistic awareness that intelligence is a measurement rather than an entity. For example, being contextually aware is more of a sign of intelligence for me than any other metric. If I can see how people respond to the immediate context that they find themselves within I am able to make judgements on the intelligence of their actions. In this way, intelligence is a practical action.</p>
  
      <p>Empathy seems to be a keyword passed around these days. How empathic somebody is toward someone else could be a sign of emotional intelligence. Yet there may also be a consideration worthy for further discussion here. Boundaries, for instance, play a role in allowing empathy to not venture too far. Having strong boundaries also may require strong communication and relationship building skills. Emotional intelligence is also part of this side of the coin.</p> 

      <p>Ultimately, emotional intelligence could be valued when working with others. As we are increasingly finding flexible means to collaborate, having somebody who can recognise the opportunities to connect with others and build local cultures is a sure sign of intelligence, regardless of how you would like to define it.</p>

      </div>
      
      <p class="blogCopy"> <span class="dropCap">T</span>he surest way to think about the float property is to first consider the way browsers render elements through a typical default flow. Browsers render the majority of html elements by default as block-level elements. A block-level element, for example, spans the full width of its container and has its height either relative to the hight of its content (text, images, other child elements, et cetera) or has its height pre-set with code. As a result, we can use this behaviour to stack elements on top of one another, like the name implies – as blocks. To illustrate, take the following exercise of stacking three squares of equal width and height on top of one another: </p>
      <pre><xmp>
        /* css */
        div {
          width: 150px;
          height: 100px;
          background-color: red;
        }

        <!-- html-->
        <div class="box1">box1</div>
        <div class="box2">box2</div>
        <div class="box3">box3</div>
      </xmp></pre>
      <p>The above code will provide you with a pattern similar to Figure A below: </p>
      <img src="images/blogs/blog-1/blockA.png" alt="#" width="33%" height="">
      <p>All is natural in the world. But how, if we do not want vertical-stack arrangements, do we stack elements horizontially as shown in Figure B below?</p>
      <img src="images/blogs/blog-1/blockB.png" alt="#" width="100%">
      
      <p>One option we have available, is float:</p>
      <pre><xmp>
        div {
          width: 150px;
          height: 100px;
          background-color: red;
          float: left; /* you could float left, right, or center */
        }
      </xmp></pre>
        
       <p>If the browser often stacks elements into block-level vertical stacks such as Figure A above, how do we stack them horizontially? There is another CSS property available to choose from, the display property, however, if we would like to retain the block level property to our elements this is not a good option because one aspect of block level elements is that they contain most of their box-model properties, such as margin. An alternative is available for us when we would like to create horizontially aligned block level items: The float property.</p>
       
       <p>Now having available to us a technique to choose from which aligns elements from vertical to horizontal configurations, we can start to manipulate box model properties and specify the shapes and spaces required of our particular design. For example, for this website, the header was built by using the float method. I did this by first creating a Figure B configuration and then adapting the width of certain elements, namely the logo, nav bar, and button. The below code is only a brief example of what this may look like:</p>

       <pre><xmp>
         /* css */
         header {
           width: 100%
           height: 200px;
         }
         h1 {
           width: 25%;
           float: left;
         }
         nav {
           width: 50%;
           float: left;
         }
         button {
           width: 25%;
           float: left;
         }

        <!-- html-->
        <header>
            <h1>logo</h1>
            <nav>
              <ul>
                <li><a>item</a></li>
                <li><a>item</a></li>
                <li><a>item</a></li>
              </ul>
            </nav>
            <button>button</button>
        </header>
      </xmp></pre>

      <p>By isolating three boxes and playing around with their dimensions a developer may find ways to create arragnments that work for their particular design. In any case I am happy to have introduced the basic principles of using the float method, albeit just the tip of the iceburg.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, the float method is used for older-browser versions. New layout techniques are avaialble for more modern user environments. For example, both flexbox and grid are now considered the industry stantard approaches for laying out web pages. Because of this, my next task in my HTML/CSS learning is to recode this website using both flexbox and grid whilst leaving float in the dust! Thanks for reading.</p>

      <p class="blogCopy"> <span class="dropCap">T</span>hanks to EDA, my long term goal for this year is to become a Junior JavaScript developer and work my way up the industry hierarchy over the course of next year. I can foresee myself doing web development work for the next three years, building up a body of knowledge capable of building modern digital products. I am specifically interested in learning react and node.</p>
      <img class="blogBanner" src="images/blogs/blog-4/banner.png" alt="#">
      <p>My strength in learning comes from my disciplined ability to stay focused and work on a problem until a solution is found. Sometimes that solution may be to abandon the issue and take a step back to then return with another approach. The limitations of my learning are absolutely to do with interest. I always aim to achieve a sense of flow in my learning, and when confronted with less than ideal (read: dry) tasks, I can lose interest quite rapidly and become demotivated. Awareness of these aspects to my learning is also a strength as it can allow me to recognise problem areas early and deal to them appropriately.  </p>
      <p>I would really like to connect with like-minded individuals and improve my listening abilities even further. I can also have a tendency from my own teaching background to find myself in advice giving situations. I would like to learn how to avoid these sorts of approaches and become more of an effective leader through other means.</p>
      <p>I have a fairly strict schedule and do quite well sticking to it. My workload management is well under control as I have allowed myself these three months to focus exclusively on this learning journey. I will manage myself and work productively by being polite, respectful, eager to both listen and help where and when I can, and bringing a sense of all-round positivity and enjoyment to the learning environment.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I may need to just take a weekend to myself away from people so I can recharge. Things can become overwhelming so two main strategies I have used in the past is to finish work in a timely manner, this means to stay on track. The second is to learn how to reduce workload and do not let my ambitions direct me toward taking on more work that needed. As a result, doing the required tasks first and then elaborating on them (such as stretch goals) is a sound strategy to avoid the common pitfalls of workload stress that comes with taking on too much all at once.</p>
      <p>The community and staff at EDA are open and easily approachable, I would get in contact with my student facilitator, Rose, and discuss how EDA could help support me in times of need. </p>
      <p>I am in a committed relationship and I block in time with my partner that fits outside of work hours. We are both well versed in this lifestyle and have discussed the increase of my workload as a result of taking this course of education. I need not to neglect my family and friends if I can manage to work in my own timely fashion. Fortunately, I do have a fairly structured balance in my life at the moment that surrounds and supports my educational goals. Growing does not happen in isolation nor without helping hands.</p>

      <p class="blogCopy"> <span class="dropCap">E</span>thics is a rather large topic that I tend to avoid for the reason that I am quite vanilla across the board. I recognise that people both make mistakes, and they may redeem themselves at a future state of events, but I also recognise at the same time that mistakes may have consequences for others and cause harm in the process. </p>
      <img class="blogBanner" src="images/blogs/blog-3/banner.png" alt="#">
      <p>It is probably a good idea to have a set of principles that we can agree to live by. I personally do not find myself in situations where I need to lie, cheat and steal. Ethically however I don’t have any experiences that I can draw form where I’ve had to make any tough choices. I am the type of person to return wallets full of cash to the police station and to teach people rather than hurt them. In most situations, I am slow to judge. Where ethics falls into this, I am uncertain, but as an undergraduate in philosophy I learned of the idea of being a “contentious moral agent” and I suppose that has stuck with me all these years.  </p>
      <p>My strengths may come from an ability to find the passion in what I am doing and let that drive the majority of the learning process. In a career setting however dream jobs are rare and hard to come by. By taking small steps toward becoming a junior javascript developer I think that passion could come through and if I am able to finish my work, the culture that surrounds that workplace may benefit form a little positivity. </p>
      <p>My ability to focus is unusual but it can go both ways: I can focus on things for a long time, but if I go down a rabbit role then I focus too much attention on tasks lower down on the priority list. Learning how to recognise these episodes may be beneficial and avoided by time management tools and clear goals that is chunked into achievable timeframes. </p>
      <p>Learning with others can be a challenge if the personality types do not gel. I have personally worked with what I would call quite obnoxious person but that was perhaps too judgemental. Often it is just the sense of constantly listening to a talkative person when you realise at the point of somebody repeating what they have said, that what they are saying may be not that efficient and they are doing it to feel heard. This culture may work for some but it does not work that well for me. What I did to work with this person was to reinforce positive aspects to what they were saying, making sure they understood they knew I had listened and understood myself, and then when things were getting repeated I would kindly remind that person that I had heard them the first time and we ought to move on to other things. It worked in the end and we managed to remain friendly toward one another, whereas there was certainly a capability for me to find disinterest in said person. I think being a good team member is learning the nuances of other personality types and recognising that it may not be them that is the issue rather the clash of decision making involved. Remaining objective is key for team work, I had learned.</p>
