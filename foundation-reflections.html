        <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
  
        <p class="blogCopy"> <span class="dropCap">I</span>have learned that I can keep to a schedule if I remain focused and disciplined on the task at hand. However, I have also learned that if I want to do my best work I need to drive and push myself through apathetic moments and take control. I’m a little older than I once was and as a result my ego is rather in harmony these days. I celebrate the potential in others to grow. We all have our moments. </p>
    
        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
  
        <p>I’m not too sure how to answer this objectively. Learning to program is quite an individual experience. I first learned to program because I was fascinated with how code was written. I did not meet anybody who could code for a long time in my life, but I suspect that If I had I would of taken to it quite strongly growing up. When I first learned JavaScript I found it incredibly difficult. With time however, I learned that certain benchmarks such as logical operations and control flows, and so on, is more like philosophy than mathematics. Values are therefore subjective to the desire for code. I wanted to learn how to build things in modern ways. </p> 
  
        <p>Self-awareness in learning is absolutely more of a guide in how I learn. If I have a learning objective, then I will persist and explore that space until I am satisfied with the knowledge gained. If you are constantly focused on your own learning however than the learning of others may be neglected as a result. Empathy may therefore contribute to celebrating the learning journey of others and provide a way to relate to the network of likeminded individuals as a whole. I’ve absolutely met passionate programmers before and if people tend to take more positive outlooks toward building things than turning quick profits, then perhaps more things could get made. </p> 
      
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
  
        <p>The lack of ES6. I was expecting more modern updates on older ways of doing things I am being completely honest. </p>
  
  
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
  
        <p>I found the algorithm challenges the hardest. There are so many ways to solve problems in JavaScript. I really needed to hit the books to remember a lot of key terminology and techniques to accomplish the tasks successfully.</p>
  
  
        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
  
        <p>There are simply fundamental skills required for any programming task. Without the code knowledge, the bootcamp may run at a pace unforgiving to students who lack the fundamentals.</p>
  
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
  
        <p>I felt that half of the core was good whilst half was a bit of a time sink. I actually used that time to practice programming before looking at the challenges. I will spend the next week continuing to explore and study JavaScript. Again this has to do with the lack of ES6 content. I understand how an absolute beginner may struggle with this however.</p>
